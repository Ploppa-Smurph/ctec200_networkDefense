<h1>CTEC 200 Network Defense wk02 Lessons 03: Footprinting and Gathering Intelligence; 04: Evaluating Human and Physical Vulnerabilities; and 05: Preparing the Vulnerability Scan</h1>
<h2>03: Footprinting and Gathering Intelligence</h2>
<h3>03A: Discover the Target</h3>
<b>Passive Reconissance</b> - gathering the first steps of information without interacting with a server. handsoff
    - using dns records and whois. 
    - find social media patterns.
    - find company server naming standards: ex: jswalley@ vs walleyjs@.... however accounts are named
    - use shodan (sp?) - has list of default password for their IT device; also has vulnerable legacy database list
        -- 
    - spiderfoot -- good tool 
    - montego -- good application 
    - study metadata from downloaded files from companies
        -- you can pull names from financial reports that are online, or such
            - ex: barry johnson's name from financing is on a report, you can then name drop
    - nmap (sense scan) -- tries to stay passive; nmap is mostly aggressive, though
    - look for 'revocation information' on 3rd party sites to remain passive
<h4>GATHERING INFORMATION</h4>
<b>Providing Insight on the Target</b>
<b>Leveraging the Intel</b>
<h4>IDENTIFYING ORGANIZATIONAL CONTACTS</h4>
<b>Scraping Social Media</b>
<b>Scouring Job Listings</b>
<h4>EXAMINING DNS INFORMATION</h4>
    <b>MX (Mail Exchange)</b> - Mail Server
    <b>NS (Nameserver)</b> - DNS 
    <b>TXT (Text)</b> - provides information about resournce such as server or network in human readable form
    <b>SRV (Service)</b> - provides host and port information on services such as VoIP (Voice over IP) or IM (Instant Messagning)

<b>nslookup</b> - command-line tool to query domain and specify various record types

<b>dig</b> - perform reverse lookup to match IP address to domain name

<b>whois</b> - can find:
    -- name of domain registrant
    -- name & mailing address of registrant organization
    -- email address and phone number of the registrant
    -- previous information regarding administrative and technical contacts
    -- identifying information about the domain's registrar
    -- status of domain, including client and server codes that concern renewal, deletion, transfer, and related information
    -- name server the domain uses
<h3>03B Gather Essential Data</h3>
<h4>USING PUBLIC SOURCE-CODE REPOSITORIES</h4>
    - GitHub
    - Bitbucket
    - SourceForge
<h4>OPTIMIZING SEARCH RESULTS</h4>
    <i>site</i> - 'site:comptia.org report' -- search comptia's site for results including 'report'

    <i>link</i> - 'link:comptia.org report'  -- search any pages that link to comptia's site that have report on the page

    <i>filetype</i> - 'filetype:pdf report' -- search PDFs including text report

    <i>inurl</i> - 'inurl:Certification report' -- reports on any pages whose URLs include test "Certification"
<h4>UNEARTHING ARCHIVED WEBSITES</h4>
    use <i>cache</i> search: <i>'cache:https://comptia.org'</i> will give the cached site

    <i><b>Wayback Machine</b></i> - website that has archive of sites going back decades
<h4>SEARCHING FOR IMAGES</h4>
<b>Reverse Image Search</b> - TinEye, Google, Yandex, Bing
<h3>03C Compile Website Information</h3>
crawl & scrape useful information in preperation for an attack. 
-- look for flaws in SSL and TLS
<b>1) Passive recon</b>: check have I been pwned, other sites for corporate accounts that could be a way in

<b>2) Ennumerate</b>: find out what services the organization has running

<b>3) Find 'robots.txt' file</b>: can have list of folders organization does NOT want indexed, those are sometimes folders hackers would be interested in

<b>4) Look at sourcecode</b>:  for 3rd party library vulnerabilities, or insecure coding

<b>5) Check API configuration</b>: check for wrong APIs, typosquatting, chaining exploits

<b>6) Capture API results</b>: use 'Burpsuite' and capture data

<b>7) Know usecase for tools</b>: develop a library of your favorite tools

<b>8) Cover your tracks</b>: VPN, use VMs, change VM locations from east to west, different countries

<b>9) Worry about the corporation server logfiles</b>: obfuscate attacks as much as possible or IPS/IDS, event logs, SIEM, and other tools will show that someone is snooping

<b>10) Packet Crafting</b>: python scripting, 'Scapy' is a tool that is often used

<h4>ENUMERATING THE TARGET WEBSITE</h4>
<b>Investigating the Website</b>

<b>Extending Your Reach</b>

<b>Evaluting the 'robots.txt' File</b>

<h4>RECOGNIZING CERTIFICATE FLAWS</h4>
<b>Discovering Certificate Details</b> 
    <i><b>SAN (Subject Alternative Name)</b></i> 

<b>Revoking the Certificate</b>
    <i><b>CRL (Certificate Revocation List)</b></i>

    <i><b>OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)</b></i>

<b>Stapling the Certificate</b>
    <i>01) Web server goes to OCSP server to check certificate validity
       02) Web server sends validated certificate to client </i>
<h3>03D Discover Open-Source Intelligence Tools</h3>
<h4>UNEARTHING OSINT TOOLS</h4>
<b>Metagoofil</b>
<b>Shodan</b>
<b>Maltego</b>
<b>Recon-ng</b>

<h4>SEARCHING METADATA</h4>
<b>Using Metagoofil</b>
    <i>-d site</i>:   scan documents on website
    <i>-t pdf</i>:    scan for PDF documents
    <i>-l 75</i>:     search for 75 documents
    <i>-n 25</i>:     download 25 files
    <i>-o comptiapdf</i>: save download to 'comptiapdf' directory 

<b>Fingerprinting with FOCA</b>
    <i>FOCA</i> - GUI OSINT tool used to discover metadata hidden within documents

<h4>RESEARCHING ORGANIZATIONA INFORMATION</h4>
<b>Collecting Data with 'theHarvester'</b>

<b>Gathering with Recon-ng</b>

<h4>Transforming Data with Maltego</h4>

<h4>Searching with Shodan</h4>
